# Power_analysis_simulations_for_RCT
This provides power analysis simulations for an RCT with one and with two treatment arms

## Folders
Project is organized into three folders:
(1) code scripts for simulations. Contains simulations for treatments with one and two arms
(2) data generated from the simulations
(3) plots of power x sample sizes for each type of RCT
